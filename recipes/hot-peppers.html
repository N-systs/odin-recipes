        <p>The most delicious cooked chilis or jalapenos you could ever have. Perfect addition to any dinner and it is a wonderful recipe for any week night or a weekend barbeque.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10-12 Medium size chili or Jalapeno peppers</li>
            <li>2 packs of cream cheese</li> 
            <li>A bag of shredded cheddar or any other shredded cheese you prefer</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>One pack of thin sliced bacon</li>
            <li>A pack of tooth picks (if you are going to grill the peppers)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps and Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take all the peppers and make sure to rinse them of any dirt or contaminants.</li>
            <li>Grab a medium sized kitchen knife and cut the top and bottoms of the peppers halfway through.</li>
            <li>Now, make a lengthwise cut meeting the slice made on the top and bottom of the peppers.</li>
            <li>Once all the peppers have been sliced, use your thumb to pry open the cuts and remove all the seeds and internal parts of the peppers.</li>
            <li>After all the seeds and insides are removed, grab a mixing bowl and add your cream cheese.</li>
            <li>Then, mix in half a cup of shredded cheese along with a pinch of paprika, a pinch of garlic powder, and salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix in the cheese and spices into the cream cheese, then use a spoon or your hands to put the cream cheese mixture into each of the peppers.</li>
            <li>Fill the peppers until the cuts made can just barely close shut.</li>
            <li>Once all the peppers are full of cream cheese you can grab your bacon.</li>
            <li>Wrap each individual pepper tightly with bacon and lay onto a baking sheet. If you want to grill the peppers then I recommend putting tooth picks through them to hold the bacon in place on the grill.</li>
            <li>Put the peppers in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>You can see the peppers are getting close to being done when the bacon changes color. Continue cooking to achieve the desired crispiness of the bacon.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</li>
        </ol>
